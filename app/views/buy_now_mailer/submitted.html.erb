<p>P.S.: The Seller has the right to accept or reject any offer based upon not only price but also terms and proving the buyers ability to buy.  Sellers may consider cash offers stronger than financing so please make sure you provide proof of funds and/or pre-approval status to make sure your offer is as strong as possible.  Nothing is final until seller and buyer executed a sales contract and a deposit is given to seller or delivered to the title company.</p>
