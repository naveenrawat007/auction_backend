Hello <%= @user.first_name %>!

The timer has ended and you have one or more offers but none of them are at or above your asking price.  So we are wanting to know if you’re willing to accept any of these offers, counter back to any of the offers or if you want us to put your property back under Best Offer or Live Online Bidding?

Your property is now in post auction status, so please go to your profile and accept, reject or counter any of your offers by messaging the buyer directly.

We are here to help you get your property sold for your Highest and Best price so let us know if you have any questions or if there’s anything we can do to help?

Best Regards,
Support@AuctionMyDeal.com
