P.S.:  If you follow the steps in our Maximum Results Marketing Guide for Wholesalers and don’t get any offers during your Best Offer or Live Online Auction then chances are your property is overpriced and you should consider reducing your price to get it SOLD?  If you don’t get any offers during your Live Online Auction then your property will automatically roll back into our Best Offer System until you get it sold, terminate your property from site or withdraw your property from active online bidding.
