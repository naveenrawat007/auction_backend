This way you don\'t have to show your deal to as many interested buyers and some will be able to make offers if your video is good enough without seeing property. You can tell the interested buyers who do want to see the property to watch the video first and if they are serious about making an offer at or above your asking price then you will show it to them. As we all know almost all buyers will need to inspect the property before they finalize a contract, but for the properties that are hard to show then this is a way to limit your showings to only ready, willing and able buyers who are ready to move forward and won\'t waste your time.</p><p style="font-size: 13px;"> Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to help you net more money on your real estate deals and your deal should be approved soon!</p> <br><p style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;"> To Your Success,</p><p style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;"> Your Support Team @</p><p style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;"> AuctionMyDeal.com</p><p style="font-size: 13px;"> P.S.: We would love to hear your feedback, so please let us know what we can do to make your experience on this site better for you?

(ex: Best Flier)</li></ul></p><p style="font-size: 13px;"> #2 Priority for Success: Making your property available for potential buyers is extremely important if you want to get your property sold. If it’s vacant and easy to show then that makes it easy, but if not then make sure that you set up at least 2 times for investors to inspect the property so that you will get multiple buyers bidding on your property. It’s always better to show more than one investor at a time so that it creates more demand on your property but even better if you can get 10 in at once. If your property is occupied and hard to show then we suggest that you upload a 3 to 4 minute video and give the winning bidder 48 hours after they are chosen as the winning bidder to inspect the property. It’s always better get get bids from investors ******And under no circumstances should you ever except any offers from an investor unless they are your Best Offer at AuctionMyDeal.com unless you want to Net LESS Money.</p><p style="font-size: 13px;"> We understand that building relationships with your inner circle of buyers is important, but don’t let them rob you of thousands of dollars on your wholesale deals by accepting your first offer.

More money for your marketing, family, nicer cars and more vacations every year.</p><p style="font-size: 13px;"> Don’t forget time is in your favor and our Best Offer System is set up to make sure that you make at least a few thousand dollars more than if you just accepted your first offer.</p><p style="font-size: 13px;"> We are committed to helping you succeed so please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions on how we can better serve you? <%= link_to "Click HERE", "#{APP_CONFIG["site_url"]}/help-and-faq", style: "color: #28608f;" %></p><p style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;"> Best of Luck in getting Your Deal SOLD!</p><p style="font-size: 13px; margin: 0px;"> Support@AuctionMyDeal.com</p><p style="font-size: 13px;"> P.S.: If you don\'t get an acceptable price during your Best Offer time frame then your property will automatically go into our Live Online Auction until the timer ends.</p> CREATE PDF FOR WHAT I\'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN<p style="font-size: 13px;"> P.S.S.: For a limited time only our affiliate partners at Angel Investors, LLC will guarantee that if they don\'t buy your deal then they will email it out to their list of 9347 Active Real Estate Investors to help you get your Deal SOLD at no cost.</p>')
